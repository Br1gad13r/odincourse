    <p class="description">I love hot cross buns and look forward to making these fruity spiced buns every Easter! I like to make the dough in a bread machine, but I have included instructions at the end of this recipe for using a stand mixer</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 large egg, separated, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant powdered milk</li>
        <li>⅜ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup dried currants</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons milk</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Put flour, warm water, white sugar, egg, egg white, butter, yeast, milk powder, and salt in a bread maker and start on dough program. </li>
        <li>When 5 minutes of kneading are left, add currants and cinnamon. Leave in the machine until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Punch down dough on a floured surface, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Shape into 12 even-sized balls and place in a greased 9x12-inch pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 35 to 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Mix egg yolk with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl; brush on dough. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from pan immediately and cool on wire rack. </li>
        <li>To make the piping glaze: Mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla together until smooth. Spoon glaze into a piping bag or a sandwich bag with the corner snipped off; pipe a cross onto each roll.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy! </li>
    </ul>
